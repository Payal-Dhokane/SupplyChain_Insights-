This repository contains a **data-driven Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project** focused on uncovering insights from a real-world dataset. The project demonstrates **data cleaning, visualization, and pattern analysis** through interactive plots and dashboards.

## Key Highlights
- Data cleaning and preprocessing for accuracy
- Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
- Correlation analysis and feature understanding
- Interactive dashboards for clear visualization
- Step-by-step workflow for easy reproducibility

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Kaggle Notebook

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the notebook and run cells sequentially  
3. Explore interactive plots and dashboards  

ðŸ“Š This project is a practical example of applying EDA to real-world datasets and preparing data for further modeling or analysis.
